 Channels are a feature of redux-saga â€” https://goo.gl/B0s6aG

 They are used here to avoid calling multiple times the getToken api
 This function is a helper used to trigger a token refresh. If it's called simultaneously by multiple sagas,
 all of the sagas will be blocked until the worker (located in sagas/auth) manages to fetch a token.
